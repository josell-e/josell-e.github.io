    <p align="center"> So more about me. My name is Josell Esmino and I am a student currently in 
		the 12th grade in James Campbell High School. I've been an active and growing artist who would like to
		become an animator and director in the next coming years. Drawing and films have been a passion of mine
		for years now and I am still learning all the ins and outs of how to succeed through the rubble in
		this. I find it very interesting on that animators nowadays deal with movies meant for kids yet nothing
		sophisticated for adults. SO I plan on making films in a mature and adult manner as it will help expand
		ideas rather than Seth Rogan movies. As an artist I would draw comics that help my storytelling and 
		character development for the career. It may take a lot of work but it will be best in the end.
		I'm not a very talkative person and I don't like discussing topics other than drawing and movies. 
		Other stuff don't interest me. If you don't like the descriptions I'm saying it's OK. Anyway that's about me.
		I hope you enjoy the site.</p>
